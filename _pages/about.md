I am a fourth-year PhD student in [Prof. Qi Zhu's lab](http://zhulab.ece.northwestern.edu) at Northwestern University.

Before joining Northwestern, I worked as a software engineer in the aerospace industry, where I performed basic research on multi-agent robotic systems.

# Current Research
My current research focuses on safe multi-agent systems which are robust to disturbances such as agent attrition and unreliable communications. Application areas include multi-robot systems, autonomous driving, etc.
