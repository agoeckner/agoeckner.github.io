I am a fourth-year PhD student in [Prof. Qi Zhu's lab](http://zhulab.ece.northwestern.edu) at Northwestern University.

Blurb about research goes here.

Before joining Northwestern, I worked as a software engineer in the aerospace and defense industry. Much of my work involved basic research on multi-agent robotics.
